# React Native Projects

Welcome to my React Native projects repository! Here, I showcase two beginner-friendly yet functional mobile applications: 

1. **Unsplash API App** - Fetches and displays unlimited images from the Unsplash API.
2. **Password Generator App** - Generates secure and customizable passwords.

Additionally, I am actively working on building more React Native projects to expand my knowledge and enhance my portfolio.

## Project 1: Unsplash API App

### Description
This React Native application uses the Unsplash API to fetch and display an unlimited collection of stunning images. It demonstrates the integration of APIs and dynamic data rendering in a mobile environment.

### Features
- Fetches images dynamically from the Unsplash API.
- Infinite scroll for an uninterrupted viewing experience.
- User-friendly interface optimized for both Android and iOS.

### Technologies Used
- React Native
- Unsplash API
- Axios for API requests
- FlatList for efficient rendering of image grids

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:GARY121github/ReactNativeProjects.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd FirstApp
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```bash

    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd PasswordGenerator
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-android
    # Or for iOS:
    npx react-native run-ios
    ```

### Usage
- Open the app on your mobile device.
- Customize the password settings.
- Tap the "Generate" button to create a new password.
- Copy the password to your clipboard for use.

## Future Enhancements
- Add advanced filters for image search in the Unsplash API app.
- Integrate password strength indicator in the Password Generator app.
- Explore more React Native components and libraries for enhanced functionality.
- Develop additional React Native projects to strengthen my portfolio and gain more hands-on experience.
